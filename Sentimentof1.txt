 a low rate annie featuring some kid who ca not act  only echoes of jordan  and weirdo actor crispin glover screwing things up old school 
the whole affair  true story or not  feels incredibly hokey  lrb it rrb comes off like a hallmark commercial 
it is a hellish  numbing experience to watch  and it does not offer any insights that have not been thoroughly debated in the media already  back in the dahmer heyday of the mid 90s 
the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film

the explosion essentially ruined  or  rather  overpowered  the fiction of the movie for me 
the nicest thing that can be said about stealing harvard lrb which might have been called freddy gets molested by a dog rrb is that it is not as obnoxious as tom greens freddie got fingered 
works on the whodunit level as its larger themes get lost in the murk of its own making
