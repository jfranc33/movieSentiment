 punchdrunk love is so convinced of its own brilliance that  if it were a person  you would want to smash its face in 
a devastating indictment of unbridled greed and materalism 
an awful lot like one of lrb spears rrb music videos in content  except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and  worse  that you have to pay if you want to see it 
get out your pooperscoopers 
about as enjoyable  i would imagine  as searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces  positively dreadful 
this is just lazy writing 
contrived  awkward and filled with unintended laughs  the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster 
the movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive 
an uglyduckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental 
a film that should be relegated to a dark video store corner is somehow making its way instead to theaters 
 unbearably lame 
the slapstick is labored  and the bigger setpieces flat 
this is the sort of lowgrade dreck that usually goes straight to video  with a lousy script  inept direction  pathetic acting  poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography  complete with visible boom mikes 
it is quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the cannes film festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere 
many went to see the attraction for the sole reason that it was hot outside and there was air conditioning inside  and i do not think that ac will help this movie one bit 
 sorority boys was funnier  and that movie was pretty bad 
with the cheesiest monsters this side of a horror spoof  which they is not  it is more likely to induce sleep than fright 
most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement 
it is a barely tolerable slog over welltrod ground 
that such a horrible movie could have sprung from such a great one is one of the years worst cinematic tragedies 
that chirpy songbird britney spears has popped up with more mindless drivel 
you will trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the zipper after eating a corn dog and an extralarge cotton candy 
a loud  lowbudget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism  urban drama 
 in this poor remake of such a well loved classic  parker exposes the limitations of his skill and the basic flaws in his vision 
offers no new insight on the matter  nor do its characters exactly spring to life 
lrb a rrb poorly executed comedy 
a profoundly stupid affair  populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility 
tries to work in the same vein as the brilliance of animal house but instead comes closer to the failure of the third revenge of the nerds sequel 
unfortunately  the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making 
the title  alone  should scare any sane person away 
another boorish movie from the iheardajoke  atafratparty school of screenwriting 
you will just have your head in your hands wondering why lees character did not just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery 
what should have been a cutting hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last weeks issue of variety 
it makes even elizabeth hurley seem graceless and ugly 
a pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere  and just seems worse for the effort 
philosophically  intellectually and logistically a mess 
the entire movie is in need of a scented bath 
there is not a single jumpinyourseat moment and believe it or not  jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects 
it is that rare combination of bad writing  bad direction and bad acting  the trifecta of badness 
you have no affinity for most of the characters 
 a complete shambles of a movie so sloppy  so uneven  so damn unpleasant that i ca not believe any viewer  young or old  would have a good time here 
it ends up being neither  and fails at both endeavors 
a real snooze 
one of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart 
this is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you  at its cluelessness  at its idiocy  at its utterly misplaced earnestness 
below is well below expectations 
i approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again  she should ask for a raise 
to better understand why this did not connect with me would require another viewing  and i wo not be sitting through this one again  that in itself is commentary enough 
oedekerk mugs mercilessly  and the genuinely funny jokes are few and far between 
the irwins scenes are fascinating  the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their deathdefying efforts 
fails in making this character understandable  in getting under her skin  in exploring motivation  well before the end  the film grows as dull as its characters  about whose fate it is hard to care 
another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing  moldering pile of  well  extreme stunt pictures 
a gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zerodimensional  unlikable characters and hackneyed  threadbare comic setups 
it is hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie 
should have gone straight to video 
not at all clear what it is trying to say and even if it were  i doubt it would be all that interesting 
what an embarrassment 
as a remake  it is a pale imitation 
the animation and game phenomenon that peaked about three years ago is actually dying a slow death  if the poor quality of pokemon 4 ever is any indication 
apparently  romantic comedy with a fresh point of view just does not figure in the present hollywood program 
it is hard to imagine any recent film  independent or otherwise  that makes as much of a mess as this one 
despite the fact that this film was not as bad as i thought it was going to be  it is still not a good movie
a yawnprovoking little farm melodrama 
the scripts judgment and sense of weight is way  way off 
franco is an excellent choice for the walledoff but combustible hustler  but he does not give the transcendent performance sonny needs to overcome gaps in character development and story logic 
lrb lee rrb treats his audience the same way that jim brown treats his women  as dumb  credulous  unassuming  subordinate subjects 
the disjointed mess flows as naturally as jolies hideous yellow  do 
one of the worst films of 2002 
i was trying to decide what annoyed me most about god is great  i am not  and then i realized that i just did not care 
jackass is a vulgar and cheaplooking version of candid camera staged for the marquis de sade set 
kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party 
this thing works on no level whatsoever for me 
every now and again  a movie comes along to remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be 
i still want my money back 
spreads itself too thin  leaving these actors  as well as the members of the commune  short of profound characterizations
 martin lawrence live is so selfpitying  i almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show 
thumbs down 
the movie suffers from two fatal ailments  a dearth of vitality and a story that is shapeless and uninflected 
stealing harvard will dip into your wallet  swipe 90 minutes of your time  and offer you precisely this in recompense  a few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious 
a movie so bad that it quickly enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes battlefield earth and showgirls 
the script falls back on too many triedandtrue shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy 
alas  getting there is not even half the interest 
bad movie 
it is supposed to be postfeminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on oprah 
 a hokey piece of nonsense that tries too hard to be emotional 
certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike  eight crazy nights is a total misfire 
director jay russell weighs down his capricious fairytale with heavy sentiment and lightweight meaning 
mckay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages  apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service 
one ca not shake the feeling that crossroads is nothing more than an hourandahalflong commercial for britneys latest album 
a shame that stealing harvard is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating  boring  and forgettable 
this is not one of the movies you would want to watch if you only had a week to live 
the story is bogus and its characters tissuethin 
should not have been allowed to use the word  new in its title  because there is not an original character  siuation or joke in the entire movie 
totally overwrought  deeply biased  and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are the greatest musicians of all time 
completely awful iranian drama  as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque 
neither revelatory nor truly edgy  merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored 
the film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes  and it is neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is 
 the films considered approach to its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop  and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama 
no  i hate it 
a rumor of angels does not just slip  it avalanches into forced fuzziness 
i have never seen lrb a remake rrb do anything as stomachturning as the way adam sandlers new movie rapes  pillages and incinerates frank capras classic 
feels at times like a giant commercial for universal studios  where much of the action takes place 
but the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging 
the innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen 
an exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound 
this kiddieoriented stinker is so bad that i even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater
gaping plot holes sink this  sub  standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth 
what you expect is just what you get  assuming the bar of expectations has not been raised above sixthgrade height 
hollywood ending is the most disappointing woody allen movie ever 
the entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another 
abysmally pathetic
i am not sure which half of dragonfly is worse  the part where nothings happening  or the part where something is happening  but it is stupid 
the characters are never more than sketches  which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach 
muddled  melodramatic paranormal romance is an alltime low for kevin costner 
the rest of the film  is dudsville 
it is fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as the country bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at disneyland 
nothing about the film  with the possible exception of elizabeth hurleys breasts  is authentic 
mckay shows crushingly little curiosity about  or is illequipped to examine  the interior lives of the characters in his film  much less incorporate them into his narrative 
an unholy mess  driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummylooking videotape  it must be labelled  hip   innovative and  realistic 
the crap continues 
the movie is almost completely lacking in suspense  surprise and consistent emotional conviction 
horrible 
the exclamation point seems to be the only bit of glee you will find in this dreary mess 
without shakespeares eloquent language  the update is dreary and sluggish 
reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap 
it would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in dragonfly  yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling  shamelessly manipulative and contrived  and totally lacking in conviction 
depicts the sorriest and most sordid of human behavior on the screen  then laughs at how clever it is being 
time literally stops on a dime in the triessohardtobecool  clockstoppers  but that does not mean it still wo not feel like the longest 90 minutes of your moviegoing life 
once icet sticks his mug in the window of the couples bmw and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue  all credibility flies out the window 
stale and
it is a stale  overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish 
it is a frightful vanity film that  no doubt  pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni 
a loud  ugly  irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target 
the sweetest thing is expressly for idiots who do not care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance 
ultimately the  yes  snaillike pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary  like some sort of martha stewart decorating program run amok 
very much a home video  and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all 
the only thing that distinguishes a randall wallace film from any other is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a randall wallace film

lrb macdowell rrb ventures beyond her abilities several times here and reveals how bad an actress she is

eventually  they will have a showdown  but  by then  your senses are as mushy as peas and you do not care who fires the winning shot 
the film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart  mind or humor of its own 
it is the kind of underinspired  overblown enterprise that gives hollywood sequels a bad name 
any reasonably creative eighthgrader could have written a more credible script  though with the same number of continuity errors 
a dull  simpleminded and stereotypical tale of drugs  death and mindnumbing indifference on the innercity streets 
what is hard to understand is why anybody picked it up 
some of the characters die and others do not  and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson  and  really  nobody in the viewing audience cares 
the film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility 
what ensues are much bloodsplattering  mass druginduced bowel evacuations  and nonetoofunny commentary on the cultural distinctions between americans and brits 
devoid of any of the qualities that made the first film so special 
a thoroughly awful movie  dumb  narratively chaotic  visually sloppy  a weird amalgam of  the thing and a geriatric  scream 
 an hourandahalf of inoffensive  unmemorable filler 
it is not a bad premise  just a bad movie 
if that does not clue you in that something is horribly wrong  nothing will 
distinctly subpar  more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine

gaghan captures the halflit  sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms  a subtlety that makes the silly  overthetop coda especially disappointing
